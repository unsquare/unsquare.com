Asia Cafe has a reputation for great Chinese food, so this past Friday I decided to check it out. Located in a shopping center on the north side of town near the intersection of 183 and Spicewood Springs, Asia Cafe is adjacent to Asia Market, which is definitely a mark in its favor. Few restaurants can boast a ready supply of fresh, authentic food right next door.

I arrived at 7pm and the restaurant was absolutely packed, with every table full and a long line for the counter. The tables in the main room were a bit crowded together, but they also have rooms for groups off to the side. I decided that taking my food to go was probably the best option, but the rush actually settled down fairly quickly, so by the time my order was ready âˆ’ about 20-30 minutes later - several tables were available.

I ordered the crispy duck and some cheese wontons, but in retrospect that was a bit of a conservative choice. Asia Cafe has a big menu with a lot of options I'd never seen at a Chinese restaurant. They also regularly add new dishes, and the board behind the counter listed more than a dozen specials. As I sat and waited for my order, I watched dozens of plates come out of the kitchen with a wide variety of meals that all looked delicious. Portions were uniformly huge, easily providing enough food for two people or a generous amount of leftovers.

The duck was wonderful, and kept me well-fed for two meals, but I'll definitely be making another trip to Asia Cafe so that I can try out something else, possibly one of their soups or tofu dishes. The only issue will be finding the right time to come so that I can find a table. I will also admit that I had a hard time finding the restaurant at first. Look for the shopping center with Big Lots and you know you're in the right place.
