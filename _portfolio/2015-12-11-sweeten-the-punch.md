excerpt: "A pathological liar narrates her life story."
---

Sweeten The Punch ([PDF][pdf]) was my second full-length play, written circa 2003. It is the life story of a narrator who is a pathological liar. 

There are also scenes where a stereotypical 1950s family deals with life in America. In retrospect, I probably added those to pad the length.

Honestly, it's a bit of a mess, but I'm sure there are some nuggets of great ideas buried somewhere deep inside.

Mostly I just liked the title and did my best to come up with a story to go along with it. Maybe I'll revisit the idea some day.
