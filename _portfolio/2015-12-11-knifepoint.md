excerpt: "A man and a woman are kidnapped and imprisoned for mysterious reasons."

Knifepoint ([PDF][pdf]) was my very first full-length play. I wrote it in college for a playwriting class, and then re-wrote it a half-dozen times before it was produced in 2003 during the fall semester of my senior year.

The play is a two-hander starring a man and a woman who are kidnapped and imprisoned for mysterious reasons. Tensions are high and only get higher as the play proceeds.

Video of the final dress rehearsal is available here:
