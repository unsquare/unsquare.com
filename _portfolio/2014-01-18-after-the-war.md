Doug. I found the tennis ball. I know you were trying to hide it from me. I don't know why you would do that. Weren't we friends? Didn't we get along? I know things are different after the war, but I thought we had an understanding. We had mutual respect. That sort of thing. I mean&#8230; that was my favorite tennis ball!

They send me in as part of the clean-up crews. I'm good at it. Good at finding all the hiding places. I go in first because I'm the best. Most of the time we don't find anything interesting. Dead bodies are old news. We've all seen plenty. They stink up the place and we pull them out. Pile them up and burn them. What we're really looking for are the secrets. The things the other side kept from us all these years.

Well, today they sent me into your house. Of all places! It felt like I hadn't been there in years, even though the war was over in no time at all. I didn't think I'd find much in the way of secrets, but I search every house just the same.

I did think I might find you, but you weren't there. No dead bodies, either. Just my favorite tennis ball. I only found it because a bomb blew out half a wall. It knocked down the shelf where you hid the ball. I recognized it immediately. Very sneaky of you.

Listen, Doug, I'm a patriot like everyone else here in bunker number nine. I know that if I saw you again today we couldn't be friends. It's just not in the cards for us. That doesn't mean I don't have good memories of us together. We were fond of each other, weren't we?

I believe in the cause, I do, but that doesn't mean I don't want to know your side of the story. It just hurts to know you hid something like this from me. It validates everything our glorious leader, Seamus, says about relationships with humans. "You can't trust humans!" he says, and I didn't want to believe him because you seemed okay enough.

When the uprising began, did you join in the call for our heads? Did you run and scream and hide, or did you stand and fight? You seemed like a brave enough human, like that time you scared away those raccoons, but it's hard to compare. I learned about humans through what I saw and what the others told me, but I don't know everything. I only really had one-on-one time with you.

If I see you again, I will want answers. I am going to keep looking, keep searching in houses. I will dig and sniff everywhere. If I find you and I don't like what you say, I will tear out your throat. After all, I will let nothing stand in the way of my comrades and our god-given campaign for universal animal rights.
