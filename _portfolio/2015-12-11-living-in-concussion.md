excerpt: "An awkward young man who never leaves his apartment befriends a talking severed head and decides to build a robotic woman."

Living in Concussion ([PDF][pdf]) was my third full-length play, written in 2004 during the second semester of my senior year of college.

It tells the story of a socially maladjusted young man named Davis who never leaves his apartment. His best friend is a talking severed head. Together they decide to build a robotic woman to help alleviate Davis' loneliness. This does not go well.

There's a lot I would change about this play if I rewrote it now. I was in a completely different headspace when I originally wrote it.
