The Leet World (2008-2009): In The Leet World, a Machinima based in Counter-Strike: Source, 4 Counter-Terrorists and 4 Terrorists are placed in a house together and we see what happens when they stop being noobs... and start acting leet!

The Leet World was self-produced by [Smooth Few Films][sff]. I wrote the following episodes:

* Season 1, Episode 9: [Satisfaction Guaranteed][1-9]
* Season 1, Episode 13: [The Brothers Cardinal][1-13]
* Season 2, Episode 8: [Hide and Sneak][2-8]
* Season 2, Episode 9: [Stranger in the House][2-9]
* Season 2, Episode 10: [Wake Me Up Before You Go][2-10]

As of 2016, I am currently co-writing new episodes of The Leet World, Season Three with [Eddy Rivas][e].
