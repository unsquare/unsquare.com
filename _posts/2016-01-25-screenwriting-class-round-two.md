I signed up for the 201 level of Tom Vaughan's [Story and Plot][s] class a few weeks ago, and I'm really looking forward to it. The class starts next Saturday, and this time around we're actually going to be writing script pages. I enjoyed the 101 class a lot, but it's definitely time I started writing a script of my own instead of limiting my creative energies to short stories and [The Leet World][tlw].

I have two ideas that feel like feature films, but of course I'm planning on using the idea I didn't bring to class last time around just because I want to make things difficult for myself.

The idea I brought last time is a contained sci-fi thriller about what might happen if teleporters existed and garage inventors started tinkering with them. The problem is that I couldn't figure out what the character arcs needed to be; it was more of a philosophical premise than an actual character-based story. I never spent the time necessary to develop it into an actual working script, but I don't plan on abandoning it entirely. I'll just come back to it some other time.

This time around, I've decided to focus on an idea that I originally thought might work best as a web series. It's a story about a home-brewer who stumbles into a world of magical beer recipes and secret societies. I have a much clearer idea of the main character's story arc, so I think I'll be able to come up with a decent outline pretty quickly and start producing pages.

As for the outline, I'm using [Amazon Storybuilder][a] to create a corkboard version. I feel like I have a pretty solid first act mapped out, but I'm not sure where the script needs to go from there. I'm planning on using the rest of this week to complete the handouts from the 101 class and fill out the outline as much as possible before class begins.
