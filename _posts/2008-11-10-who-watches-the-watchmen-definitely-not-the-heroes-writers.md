First off: a disclaimer. I'm going to discuss this week's Heroes episode in my post, so if you're spoiler averse, please stop reading now.

With that out of the way, I think those of us who are current on the newest season of Heroes can all safely agree that the show is a complete mess. By the same token, I think if you *are* current on the show, it's because there's still something about it that keeps you hooked and ready for the next episode. It's almost as if it has some kind of charisma that makes you want to forgive its plot-holes and serious lapses in writing.

It's why I keep watching, and keep hoping that the writing will rise above the current level and the writers will avoid any serious lapses in logic or character motivation. I have a feeling I will continue to get my hopes up only to have them dashed yet again.

This week's episode, "Villains", was a particularly good example. It focused entirely on a flashback seen through the eyes of a "dream-walking" Hiro. It was nice to have an episode that centered on characterization as opposed to express-train "save the world" plotlines, but at the same time it only introduced more serious logical lapses to an already overstuffed storyline.

Considering how this season has been received in the press and by fans, this episode felt like a last-ditch effort to remind the folks at home about the good times from season one. A number of familiar plot points from the first season were revisited and fleshed out from new perspectives. For the most part these details weren't much more than filler, but one storyline did at least have an interesting premise, namely that Sylar's descent into murder and mayhem wasn't entirely his own doing.

Essentially the roles are reversed here, with Noah Bennett as the manipulative Company man ("villain") who wants Sylar to keep killing so that they can study him, and Sylar as the relative innocent ("hero") who truly regrets his initial act of violence and tries to commit suicide out of guilt. Sylar is a fascinating character, and I do like seeing more of his backstory, but I do wish that it didn't have to come at the cost of the imposing air of menace he cultivated throughout seasons one and two. That isn't my biggest problem with this storyline, however; my real issue is with the involvement of Kristen Bell's character, Elle.

In this flashback storyline, we are told that Bennet and Elle partnered together to study Sylar. Elle was sent in undercover to draw him out of his shell by befriending him. She has second thoughts, however, and begins to have sympathy for Sylar as they become close, and she asks Bennett to back off.

The big disconnect is that when we meet Elle for the first time in season two, she is a daddy's girl and an immature mess, completely sheltered and reliant on The Company for everything. In her scenes here, she seems much more in-control and mature, not to mention moral. In addition to that complete change in character, there are scenes later in season two where Elle saves several characters from a rampaging Sylar. I don't have the episode in front of me to watch, but from what I remember there wasn't even a hint of a shared history when they confronted each other.

You could, perhaps, explain some of this away as a case of a serious mind-wipe or manipulation performed on Elle so that she doesn't remember what happened with Sylar, but that seems like a lazy explanation for what is, on the whole, half-assed writing. This particular storyline felt like it had some potential to be interesting, but it barely stands up to any kind of scrutiny. Overall, this week's episode amounted to nothing more than plotholes interrupted by filler.

In conclusion, I think Heroes is best appreciated when you don't analyze it too closely. I liked this week's episode a lot more when I first started writing this post, and my opinion seriously went downhill from there. Doesn't mean I'm going to stop watching, though. Shameful, really...
