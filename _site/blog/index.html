					<p>If you thought my last post in this series was belated, this one takes the cake!</p>

<p>I just barely stuck to my writing goals in June and July. I had more than one day where I seriously considered throwing in the towel and calling the whole thing off, but I still managed to soldier on (for the most part)</p>

<p>We went to Palm Springs in the middle of June, right after Amy’s job ended. I gave myself permission to skip writing for those days since it was a vacation. I knew I’d have a hard time getting anything done after hanging out poolside all day, and I wasn’t wrong.</p>

<p>I also gave myself the day off when we went to Santa Barbara in July for Amy’s job interview at UCSB. I drove both ways, and our day in town on Saturday was pretty jam-packed. I was completely exhausted by the time we got home, so I definitely needed another day off.</p>

<p>However, I did finally miss a day of writing on July 24th. I was so exhausted that I didn’t even have the energy to write a journal entry. I could have declared that the end of my writing streak, but when I thought about it, I realized that the most important thing was that I at least <em>try</em> to write every day.</p>

<p>If I reach the end of the year and I managed to write on all but a handful of days, I would still consider that a huge win. With that in mind, I decided to add a new rule to my daily goal to help me keep things going: if I miss a day, it doesn’t count as long as I work on one of my projects the next day.</p>

<p>I can’t count a journal entry or a blog post as my makeup writing, but if I write fiction, scripts pages or do some outlining, I’m good to go. That way I can still recover even if I miss a single day. If I miss two days in a row and it isn’t a vacation, that’s when I’ll need to restart my writing streak.</p>

<p>In between journal entries, I did do a little bit of productive work these past two months. I spend a good amount of time brainstorming and outlining for an ongoing project. I also finally managed to resubmit my story at the end of July. I think I’m finally happy with the state of my story, so I don’t plan on rewriting it if I end up submitting again.</p>

<p>I’ve made a lot of positive steps these last two months, but I still beat myself up when it feels like I’ve done nothing but write journal entries for weeks. Maybe I should try to do more writing exercises so that I won’t have to resort to journal entries. The main issue is, as always, finding the time to write.</p>

<p><strong>Final counts for June 2016:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>18.5 hours of related work</li>
  <li>0 script pages</li>
  <li>74 words of fiction</li>
  <li>4347 words of non-fiction</li>
  <li>4421 total words</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Final counts for July 2016:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>17 hours of related work</li>
  <li>0 script pages</li>
  <li>378 words of fiction</li>
  <li>4434 words of non-fiction</li>
  <li>4812 total words</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>These were my goals for June:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Ideally I want to finish the outline for my current project, but we’re already halfway through the month as I write this, so it might be a tall order.</li>
  <li>I’d like to write a blog post for Full of Words that isn’t another book review. It’s been a while since I’ve written one of those.</li>
  <li>Spend some time researching or brainstorming for Hops Arcana.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Here’s how those goals played out:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>I’m really damn close on this. I just need one more brainstorming session and then I should be able to knock out the final part of the outline.</li>
  <li>I did write two book reviews in July, but I didn’t manage to write anything else for Full of Words. Maybe this month?</li>
  <li>I haven’t looked at Hops Arcana since my screenwriting class ended.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Here are my goals for August:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Have one final brainstorming session for my ongoing project, then finish my outline and start writing. Ideally, finish a first draft by the end of August.</li>
  <li>Write at least three posts for Full of Words - reviews or otherwise.</li>
  <li>Finish a rough draft of a new short story.</li>
</ol>

					<p>Well, here it is, halfway through the month of June, and I’m just now getting around to posting about my writing progress for May. That tells you a lot about what kind of month it was, and how my writing is going in general.</p>

<p>The most significant thing I did last month was re-submit <em>Ghost of a Friend</em> after it was rejected several times. I ended up rewriting it a little bit every time I submitted, which got a little nerve-wracking after a certain point. I started worrying that my changes weren’t actually improving the story.</p>

<p>Before I submitted that last time, I cut around 800 words. The story was starting to feel a little bloated, so I decided that cuts were in order. I also discovered that there aren’t many markets willing to accept a story longer than 5000 words. I didn’t manage to get it under 4000 words like I’d hoped, but I did cut out a few superfluous scenes.</p>

<p>I received my fourth rejection a few days ago, but I haven’t gotten around to resubmitting yet. It’s definitely a bit demoralizing, sending your work out into the world only to get back nothing but rejections. That said, I don’t know if I’m quite ready to send it to somewhere a bit less challenging. I’d like to keep shooting for the stars.</p>

<p>However, it turns out that the best way to keep myself from obsessively rewriting is to submit the story to a slow-moving market. I’m planning on tweaking a few small things before I submit again, but I’ll probably pick another slow market. It was kind of a relief to be able to put the story out of my mind for a few weeks while I waited for a response.</p>

<p>As for the rest of my time last month, there were a lot of days where I wrote in my journal as a last resort. That’s probably why it feels like I didn’t do enough. I didn’t make any inroads on another short story, but I did write a handful of blog posts.</p>

<p>The biggest bright spot came near the end of the month when I had a very productive brainstorming session for another project. Hopefully it won’t be too much longer before I can dig in and start writing.</p>

<p><strong>My final counts for May 2016 were:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>14 hours of related work</li>
  <li>1 script page</li>
  <li>565 words of fiction</li>
  <li>6548 words of non-fiction</li>
  <li>7113 total words</li>
</ul>

<p>Definitely an anemic showing for new fiction, but that’s probably because I spent so much time deleting words from my story. I wrote a bit more non-fiction during the month, but it was mostly journal entries rather than blog posts.</p>

<p>Overall not a terrible word count, and I did finally spend a little bit of time working on a script, so I’ll count that in the win column.</p>

<p><strong>These were my goals for May:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Start something new, whether it’s a short story or a script for a new web series.</li>
  <li>Spend some time working on the outline for my screenplay. Don’t let it lay fallow for too long.</li>
  <li>Don’t leave writing until the end of the day. Write more before work or during my lunch break. Take time to write at the library or a coffee shop.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Here’s how those goals played out:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Nope. No luck here.</li>
  <li>Hops Arcana isn’t getting much love in these parts, but I did spend some serious time brainstorming for another project.</li>
  <li>Man, I <em>struggle</em> with this one. I’m never awake enough to write first thing in the morning, I never feel like writing on my breaks at work, and I’m tired in the evenings. It’s a no-win scenario. The good news is that I’m on such a streak these days that the momentum forces me to at least write <em>something</em> before I go to sleep at night.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Here are my goals for June:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Ideally I want to finish the outline for my current project, but we’re already halfway through the month as I write this, so it might be a tall order.</li>
  <li>I’d like to write a blog post for Full of Words that isn’t another book review. It’s been a while since I’ve written one of those.</li>

					<p>As of this writing, I’ve submitted <em>Ghost of a Friend</em> to three markets and received three rejections, each one quicker than the last.</p>

<p>After I received a rejection from <a href="http://firesidefiction.com">Fireside</a>, I looked for other places to submit, prioritizing markets that paid a pro rate (more than 5 cents a word) and had a quick average response time.</p>

<p>I definitely don’t want to submit somewhere that would keep it for months without responding. I also refuse to do any submissions by mail. The idea of mailing out a story feels like abandoning it to the mercies of a black hole.</p>

<p>The three markets I’ve submitted to so far all have acceptance rates of <em>less than one percent</em> according to <a href="http://duotrope.com">Duotrope</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>0.40% for Fireside</li>
  <li>0.08% for <a href="http://clarkesworldmagazine.com">Clarkesworld</a></li>
  <li>0.08% for <a href="https://www.sfsite.com/fsf/">Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Those are some <em>pretty long odds</em>. Knowing that helped take away most of the sting of rejection, but after I heard back from Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction, I did wonder if I really was sending out the best possible version of my story.</p>

<p>When I sent the story to Fireside, it was exactly 5000 words long - their maximum - but I felt like there were a few moments I cut short to stay under that limit. As soon as it was rejected, I added another 150 or so words to beef up those scenes. That’s the version I sent to Clarkesworld and F&amp;SF.</p>

<p>Problem is, I’m starting to think that <em>Ghost of a Friend</em> might be a little bloated at 5000+ words. I’ve looked through submission requirements for a lot of markets, and it seems like very few places accept stories that length. 4000 or 3000 word limits are very common.</p>

<p>After my third draft, I swore that I wasn’t going to do any more major revisions because I don’t want to get stuck working on the same damn story forever. Putting all of my eggs into a single basket is not a great idea, especially because short stories aren’t particularly lucrative on their own. Even still, it seems like I might be doing myself a disservice if I keep submitting this version of the story.</p>

<p>My new goal is to get the story under 4000 words. I think I can tighten up the first few scenes and get to the good stuff much sooner.</p>

<p>That means I’m going to hold off on submitting for a fourth time until I’ve made yet another pass. Hopefully it won’t take too long to cut it down as much as possible.</p>

<p>As an aside, I just re-read <em><a href="http://unsquare.com/portfolio/writing/burning-love/">Burning Love</a></em> to try and remember how I managed to write and sell a short story four years ago on my very first attempt. The story definitely holds up, but I had completely forgotten that I named the main character Nate… which is also one of the names I used in <em>Ghost of a Friend</em>. I should probably change that, haha.</p>

		</div>
		<div class="inner-wrap">

					<img src="http://unsquare.com/images/pen-paper-teaser.jpg" class="post-teaser-image image-left" alt="April by the Numbers" itemprop="image">
				
				
					<p>April was a good month for writing. I finally managed to buckle down and finish a third draft of <em>Ghost of a Friend</em>, and I did it with enough time left to submit to <a href="http://www.firesidefiction.com">Fireside</a> during their open period. I worked on the newest draft in small chunks throughout April, writing 100 or 200 words here and there until I finished it in a rush of more than 1200 words at the end of the month.</p>

<p>I’ve wanted to submit to Fireside ever since the magazine first launched a few years ago, so I’m glad the timing worked out. My submission was one of <strong>2,393 stories</strong> they received during the month of April, so the probability of my story getting accepted is pretty low (<a href="http://www.duotrope.com">Duotrope</a> says they currently have a <strong>.51% acceptance rate</strong>!), but at least I made the effort.</p>

<p>If my story is rejected, my plan is to submit it to all of the pro-level markets on Duotrope one by one starting with the quickest to respond. I’ve resolved to keep submitting <em>Ghost of a Friend</em> until it finds a home.</p>

<p>I may tweak it a bit before I send it to another market, however. I had to cut a few words to come in under 5000 for Fireside, and I think the final conversation scene came out a little rushed as a result. That said, I don’t think the story should be much longer than it currently is, so it might be best if I cut from scenes earlier in the story to make more room for that conversation.</p>

<p>Now that I’ve submitted the story, I need to decide what I want to write next. Ideally I should have more than one piece ready for submission at all times, but I also want to work on my screenplay before I lose any more steam on that idea. As soon as I started focusing on other projects, the screenplay just sort of fell by the wayside.</p>

<p>Right now the story idea that appeals to me the most is called <em>Drones: A Love Story</em>. I wrote a draft of <em>Drones</em> a few years ago when Amazon first announced their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/b?node=8037720011">drone delivery program</a>. I finished it in a very short amount of time and then ultimately abandoned the story when I was unhappy with the results.</p>

<p>I recently came up with a new approach to <em>Drones</em> that I think will fix a lot of the issues I had with the original draft. It’ll be a page one rewrite, but the story feels fairly complete in my head, so it’s just a matter of sitting down and knocking it out.</p>

<p>I think the main thing I need to do in May is prioritize my time. It’s likely I’ll have to split my writing time between projects for myself and projects for others, so I’ll have limited bandwidth for something completely new. Knowing that, I should probably try to get started on something soon so that I can have a few irons in the fire.</p>

<p>I could technically still submit to the <a href="http://austinfilmfestival.com">Austin Film Festival</a> if I get something ready by May 20th, but I think the only category I could pull off at this point is the <a href="http://austinfilmfestival.com/submit/scripted-digital-series/">Scripted Digital Series</a>. That category allows for “1-3 scripted episodes, totaling no more than 30 pages in length”, which is totally a doable amount of writing if I break out the stories really well. All I’d need to do is decide on a series concept.</p>

<p><strong>My final counts for April 2016 were:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>13 hours of related work</li>
  <li>0 script pages</li>
  <li>3712 words of fiction</li>
  <li>4146 words of non-fiction</li>
  <li>7858 total words</li>
</ul>

<p>This is what I would consider a pretty good balance for an average month. My total word count was higher than last month, and the work was spread pretty evenly between categories. The only category that continues to get short shrift is script pages, but May might change that.</p>

<p><strong>These were my goals for April:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Finish my final rewrite of Ghost of a Friend and submit it to <em>at least one market</em> by the end of the month.</li>
  <li>Create my outline board (i.e. draw lines on the board and lay out the sections) and outline <em>at least one sequence</em> of my screenplay.</li>
  <li>Find more ways to get concrete wins that make me feel like I’m progressing as a writer.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Here’s how those goals played out:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>I waited until pretty close to the last minute, but I ultimately nailed this goal. I finished my story and submitted it to Fireside on April 30th with half a day to spare.</li>
  <li>I didn’t touch anything related to my screenplay during the month of April, so I’ll have to revisit this goal in May.</li>
  <li>In retrospect, this goal was pretty vague. I think for my purposes, finishing my story counts. It also counts that I spent more days working on fiction in April.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Here are my goals for May:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Start something new, whether it’s a short story or a script for a new web series.</li>
  <li>Spend some time working on the outline for my screenplay. Don’t let it lay fallow for too long.</li>
  <li>Don’t leave writing until the end of the day. Write more before work or during my lunch break. Take time to write at the library or a coffee shop.</li>
</ol>

					<p>Tracking your writing can be kind of brutal after a while, especially if you have a month where it feels like you didn’t hit your goals. March was one of those months despite the fact that I was actually very productive in a few important ways.</p>

<p>First off, a lot of my writing time in March was devoted to several weeks of my <a href="http://storyandplot.com">screenwriting class</a>. We read scripts (written by class members) and watched a few movies to understand their structures. We were also given the occasional homework assignment specific to our script ideas.</p>

<p>I counted my time spent in class or working on assignments under the “Related Work” column of my spreadsheet, because it was a valuable use of my time that required a decent amount of mental energy. That time spent also tended to preclude any other kind of writing work.</p>

<p>Additionally, because I needed to devote my time to class (I did pay for it, after all), I made a point of setting aside my short stories until class was finished. This meant that my fictional output was almost non-existent in March.</p>

<p>As for my non-fiction writing, I published four book reviews over at <a href="http://fullofwords.com">Full of Words</a> and four posts on this site. Those eight posts amount to 4171 words altogether, which means I did around 1552 words of journal-writing.</p>

<p>I’m actually pretty proud of myself for writing eight posts in one month - that’s an average of two posts a week. It’s a rare month when I blog that consistently, so good on me.</p>

<p>Even though I wrote a good number of blog posts and spent a lot of time working on assignments for class, I felt like I wasn’t productive enough because my fiction word count was so low.</p>

<p>Maybe it’s just a psychological hang-up that I need to get over, but it doesn’t really feel like I’m achieving my writing goals if I’m not producing a quantifiable number of words (or pages).</p>

<p>Fiction writing feels like a more achievable goal than screenwriting, so that’s probably why I’m so focused on word count as a metric.</p>

<p>I don’t really want to start producing screenplay pages before I have an outline ironed out. I know for a fact that I’d have to throw out a bunch of work if I started writing without planning. I know it’s a delaying tactic, but that doesn’t mean it’s wrong.</p>

<p>Ghost of a Friend is a good example of what happens when I write without planning. I’ve reworked it significantly after every rewrite, and I don’t think I discovered the core of the story until after multiple rounds of feedback and rewrites. That’s kind of an inefficient process… but somehow it produces results, flawed as they may be.</p>

<p>I know in my heart of hearts that outlining improves my writing, but for some reason I still freeze up at the thought of planning out a story. Some stubborn idiot part of my brain rebels and I don’t get anything done.</p>

<p>I’m not really sure where to go from here other than trying to tip the balance towards outlining instead of just pantsing everything.</p>

<p><strong>My final counts for March 2016 were:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>26.5 hours of related work</li>
  <li>0 script pages</li>
  <li>559 words of fiction</li>
  <li>5723 words of non-fiction</li>
  <li>6282 total words</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>To recap, these were my goals for March:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Finish a draft of an outline for my screenplay.</li>
  <li>Do a final pass on my newest short story and submit it for publication.</li>
  <li>Fewer journal entries and more fiction.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Here’s how those goals actually played out:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>I didn’t draft an outline, but I did come up with a list of ten set-pieces that feel really solid. I can see a potential through-line for the movie in those pieces, so it’s just a matter of formalizing it. I made measurable progress, but I didn’t end up with a finished product like I’d hoped.</li>
  <li>I made it halfway through a final pass on Ghost of a Friend. I stopped at the point when I realized that I needed to rewrite a huge chunk of the story. I’d also spent almost four hours working on the rewrite and it was time to leave the coffee shop.</li>
  <li>I feel like I whiffed on this one. My only attempts at fiction-writing were fitful stabs at starting a new short story. I’m not really happy with any of those fragments, so it’s back to the drawing board with my new ideas. I also resorted to writing in my journal way too many nights.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Here are my goals for April:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Finish my final rewrite of Ghost of a Friend and submit it to <em>at least one market</em> by the end of the month.</li>
  <li>Create my outline board (i.e. draw lines on the board and lay out the sections) and outline <em>at least one sequence</em> of my screenplay.</li>
  <li>Find more ways to get concrete wins that make me feel like I’m progressing as a writer.</li>
</ol>

					<p>As an experiment, I decided to start using <a href="http://hemingwayapp.com">Hemingway</a> to proof my blog posts and work assignments. Hemingway is a free web-based tool that catches a few common grammatical sins and rates the “readability” of your text.</p>

<p>My corporate writing is meant for a wide audience known for their short attention span, so making sure that my newsletters and documentation are clear and simple is a priority. Hemingway works really well in this scenario, and it’s okay if the results come out a little bland.</p>

<p>As for my blog, the most common posts I make are book reviews meant for a general audience. If someone finds my site from a Google search, it’s important that my content be accessible. That said, I do tend to make the occasional rhetorical flourish when I’m passionate about a book, and those are oftentimes my favorite posts. I’m confident that my best writing would never pass Hemingway’s readability standards.</p>

<p>After a few days of using Hemingway for my writing, I started feeling stifled by its rules. I need all the help I can get when it comes to avoiding passive voice, but I’m not sure I think that complex sentences are such a big deal, and adverbs do have their place now and then.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, whenever Hemingway highlights something in my writing, my instinct is to rewrite that section obsessively until the highlight is gone. This means that I massage complex sentences until they are uniform in length and simplicity. This might make my writing easier to read, but I also think it removes a lot of what makes me unique and interesting as a writer.</p>

<p>When the app first launched, one of the first things people pointed out is that <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/hemingway-takes-the-hemingway-test">even Hemingway wouldn’t pass all the app’s rules 100% of the time</a>. The dirty little secret of English grammar is that a lot of the rules are just suggestions to ignore whenever your writing style calls for it.</p>

<p>For example, I recently read <a href="http://fullofwords.com/reviews/treacherous-parts-you-too-can-have-a-body-like-mine/">You Too Can Have a Body Like Mine</a>, which has such a high rate of adverbs per paragraph that it was clearly a conscious stylistic choice by the author. Whether that choice was <em>successful</em> is another question entirely.</p>

<p>For now, I’ve stopped running my day-to-day writing through Hemingway. I suppose I could always use it to check for passive voice and ignore all its other suggestions, but that would take a bit of restraint on my part.</p>

					<p>I’ve Kickstarted a few things over the years, but I’m much slower on the trigger these days. There aren’t any projects I regret funding, but there are definitely categories I don’t fund any more.</p>

<p>I have more than enough games to play, for example, and I’ve barely scratched the surface of the ones I funded through Kickstarter. Instead, I put most of my funding dollars towards fiction magazines and anthologies. They always seem like worthy causes even if I never get around to reading the stories. Also, magazines tend to deliver their rewards on time.</p>

<p>I’ve also shifted most of my funding towards Patreon instead of Kickstarter. Most of the creators I want to support release content on a regular schedule. They’ve all realized that it makes way more sense to send them a few dollars every month instead of hoping they reach full funding for their newest campaign.</p>

<p>One of the first people I supported on Patreon was Jeph Jacques, who created <a href="http://questionablecontent.net">Questionable Content</a>, the only webcomic I still follow.</p>

<p>When I first started reading QC, I read maybe a decade of his strips in a few days’ time. I enjoyed them so much that I bought the collected editions as a way to pay him back for all of that entertainment. Patreon is actually a much better way to support him because his comics never really looked right in print. I can also show my support on an ongoing basis instead of whenever I decide to order a book from him.</p>

<p>One of the creators I’ve supported on both Kickstarter and Patreon is <a href="http://firesidefiction.com">Fireside Fiction</a>, a magazine that has been around for a few years now. I support Fireside because they pay really nice professional rates, and they publish authors I enjoy. I want Fireside to stick around long enough that I have the chance to submit a story.</p>

<p>When they were doing yearly Kickstarters, there was always the danger they might miss their target and close up shop. Now that they’ve transitioned over to Patreon and reached a sustainable level, there’s a much better chance they’ll stick around for a good long time.</p>

<p>The final creator I’m funding is <a href="http://strangehorizons.com">Strange Horizons</a>, another magazine. If I remember correctly, I started funding them because they were having a fund drive and authors I follow on Twitter were advocating for them. I really just like supporting fiction markets because I want more chances to submit my stuff to some cool places. Also I always want to read more good short fiction.</p>

<p>In the future, I’ll probably favor Patreon over any new Kickstarters. I think the only project I’ve funded over there recently is a blu-ray collection of <a href="http://www.bitterfilms.com">Don Hertzfeldt’s</a> short films, which seemed like a worthwhile thing to own.</p>

<p>I think I’d rather put my money towards things I’m already enjoying instead of projects that might pay off two years down the line.</p>

		<div class="inner-wrap">

					<img src="http://unsquare.com/images/collaboration-teaser.jpg" class="post-teaser-image image-left" alt="Collaboration Is Key" itemprop="image">
				
				
					<p>Writing is a bit of a contradiction: the physical act of writing usually happens in solitude, but the only way to succeed at writing is through collaboration.</p>

<p>When I say that, I don’t just mean the sorts of collaborations where two people sit down and try to write one story. I also mean collaboration in the sense that everyone who gives you feedback or helps you brainstorm is a collaborator.</p>

<p>The people in your support system can be some of the most important collaborators you’ll ever have, even if the only credit they’ll ever get is in the acknowledgements or a thank you speech at an awards ceremony.</p>

<p>There is this romantic idea of the writer who disappears into a cabin somewhere and whips up the Great American Novel, fully formed. It’s complete bullshit.</p>

<p>Even masterpieces needed a good editor, and all of the classic authors worked with one. Most of them probably also had beta readers, friends, and spouses who read their work and gave them feedback.</p>

<p>I’ve been working hard to develop my craft by doing something writing-related every day, but making a habit is just the first step on my path to development. Whenever I finish a new unit of story, I can’t just send it out into the world and try to win awards or get it published. Instead, I need the reality check of some good feedback from people I trust.</p>

<p>In fact, I’d say that I need the help of others at all points in the process - <strong>before</strong>, <strong>during</strong> and <strong>after</strong>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>My writing turns out much better whenever I have someone to use as a sounding board for my ideas.</li>
  <li>I’m far more motivated to write when I know people are waiting for my work.</li>
  <li>My stories are only ever improved by the cycle of feedback and rewrites.</li>
</ol>

<p>The biggest problem I’m facing right now is that asking for feedback is an imposition on someone else’s time. Everyone who reads my story is doing me a favor, especially if they read it quickly.</p>

<p>I recently sent my newest story out to a few friends and asked for their feedback. More than one of them was kind enough to do me the favor of reading my story and providing a thoughtful, detailed response. Everything they’ve told me is going to be a huge help once I actually get around to doing my final rewrite, but even as I appreciated their feedback, it occurred to me that I can only ask my friends for this kind of favor so many times.</p>

<p>I mean, sure, I have great friends who are more than willing to help me out, and I’m definitely willing to do the same for them whenever I can, but I don’t want to abuse that relationship. If I’m using up favors every time I ask for feedback on one of my stories, it feels like I should save those favors for when I really need them.</p>

<p>What I really need is some kind of arrangement that doesn’t rely on the kindness of my friends. Finding a writing group would be the ideal solution. Writing groups are founded on the principle that everyone has to give and get feedback on a regular basis. I wouldn’t feel guilty about asking a group to read my stuff because I’d be earning my keep by reading their work in return.</p>

<p>The problem with writing groups is that I can’t seem to find one to join, and I haven’t had any luck trying to found one. I talked to a few writers from last year’s screenwriting class about starting a group, but I couldn’t get anyone to commit to actually getting together for a meeting. Eventually everyone just stopped responding to my emails and I wrote off the whole thing.</p>

<p>I’m planning on trying again with my newest class, but I’m not sure how much more successful I’ll be. At least one person in class seems driven enough to actually make good on a writing group, but I’m not sure about everyone else. That also wouldn’t solve my problem when it comes to getting feedback on short stories; any group I found with the people from class would naturally focus on screenwriting.</p>

<p>I’d also like to figure out how to find myself a writing partner. Writing <a href="http://smoothfewfilms.com/theleetworld/">The Leet World</a> with <a href="http://eddyrivas.com">Eddy</a> is the closest I’ve ever come to a true writing partnership, but he’s a busy dude and I think we have different priorities for our writing. It would also be a big help if I could find a partner who actually lived in the same place as me.</p>

<p>For now, I’m going to keep plugging away on my own while I work on building up that network of collaborators.</p>

					<p>The second month is usually where it all falls apart. My dedication to a goal starts slipping and I start coming up with more and more reasons why I don’t <em>actually</em> need to keep doing it.</p>

<p>The last few times I’ve tried to commit to a daily writing habit, I’ve given up pretty quickly after that first month. I’m sure that one of the reasons I’ve had a hard time sticking to my goals is that I made it very easy to fail. This time around, I’ve done what I can to give myself more ways to succeed, and so far it seems to be paying off.</p>

<p>I had a bit of a dip in productivity in February, but I still reached a few milestones. My overall output was lower versus January, but I finished a second draft of my newest short story on February 10th. I sent it off for feedback and received some very thoughtful responses, but I haven’t actually sat down to start my next (and hopefully final) revision.</p>

<p>Instead, I’ve been trying to focus on work for my screenwriting class, which does take up a decent chunk of time every week. I’m still stuck in the brainstorming stage, but I’m hoping to make some concrete progress soon. i want to turn in my outline and get some feedback. I keep telling myself that I’m going to sit down and devote a solid chunk of time to some serious brainstorming, but I’ve been bad about setting aside the hours.</p>

<p>I feel like I used journaling as a fallback more in February than I did in January. I’m also counting my time spent in class or doing homework under the “related work” column. This meant that there were several days in a row where I counted nothing but work for class. Although outlining and brainstorming are crucial parts of the creative process, I’d like to avoid having to count journal entries as my daily writing if at all possible.</p>

<p><strong>My final counts for February 2016 were:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>20 hours of related work</li>
  <li>0 script pages</li>
  <li>2878 words of fiction</li>
  <li>5257 words of non-fiction</li>
  <li>8135 total words</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Here are my goals for March:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Finish a draft of an outline for my screenplay.</li>
  <li>Do a final pass on my newest short story and submit it for publication.</li>
  <li>Fewer journal entries and more fiction.</li>
</ol>

					<p>I recently finished the second draft of a new short story, and at the moment I’m feeling pretty good about it.</p>

<p>The story was inspired by a prompt from <a href="http://the-five-hundred.com">The Five Hundred</a> that I used as a jumping-off point and then ultimately ignored. The story wasn’t finished after 500 words, and I was feeling inspired, so I just kept going.</p>

<p>I finished the first draft on <strong>January 17th</strong> with a total of <strong>3123 words</strong>. I sent it off to a few people to read and got two sets of feedback, both of which were very helpful.</p>

<p>The next step was to print out the draft and read it aloud with a red pen in my hand. I ended up doing rewrites and tweaks throughout. I think the combination of reading it aloud and working from a printed copy helped me get some necessary perspective on the story.</p>

<p>As I read through the story, I changed the narration from present-tense to past-tense. I also decided to delete several unnecessary characters and give two of the remaining characters more scene time. Finally, I came up with something more active for the main character to do, since one piece of feedback I got was that he was very passive throughout.</p>

<p>After I finished the red pen read-through, I let a few days pass before I sat down and incorporated the changes into my <a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php">Scrivener</a> draft. Once that was done, I got down to the business of writing a new scene in the middle of the story as well as a new ending.</p>

<p>When I finished the second draft on <strong>February 10th</strong>, it came in significantly longer at a total of <strong>4422 words</strong> despite the fact that I’d deleted two scenes. I started the story on January 14th and finished the second draft slightly less than a month later, which is a pretty decent turnaround time.</p>

<p>As soon as I finished the second draft, I sent it off to my beta readers. I included two new people who didn’t get a chance to read it the first time around. My hope is that I’ll get some fresh perspectives on the story from people who never saw the first draft.</p>

<p>Although I feel good about the story, I’m not entirely sure if I pulled off the ending. I’m looking forward to seeing what my readers have to say about it. Ideally, I’d like to start submitting this story before the end of February.</p>

<p>As for what comes next in my writing queue, I need to spend some quality time with my outline for screenwriting class. I let story rewrites take precedence and now I don’t  have much to show for myself at this week’s class.</p>

<p>Although I would like to have more than one story ready for submission, I don’t want to neglect my outline. That means I’m going to put a pin in my stories for the time being and focus on getting my outline into shape as soon as possible.</p>
